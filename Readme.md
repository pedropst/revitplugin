Revit Plugin to automatically run all wires tags into an electrical project.

This not a finished product/project.


PS.: The wire connector should be in a nested family to work properly.

I'll be finishing the project in December/22, and releasing a stable and more explained version.
If you have ideas for new features let me know about it, you could open an issue for that or DM me on twitter.
